# UI Prototype

Our [prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/eF8Nwqi88dUXHkD92kE4xA/Smart-Room-Prototype?node-id=83%3A379) was modeled in the interface design tool *Figma*. 

Inside the *Pages-Tab*, found on the upper left side of the screen, are two pages, **Desktop** and **Mobile**. 

We designed two versions of the webapp, one for big screens, typically used in laptops or for pc screens, and one for small mobile phones screens. To switch between the two design, click on the Figma logo in the upper left corner of the screen. After clicking a small drop-down menu opens which shows the available pages. The little checkmark next to the page name shows which page is currently displayed. 

To preview the prototype click on the *play-button* in the upper right corner of the page.

Otherwise use these links open the presentation mode for the [desktop](https://www.figma.com/proto/eF8Nwqi88dUXHkD92kE4xA/Smart-Room-Prototype?node-id=83%3A1058&scaling=contain&page-id=83%3A379&starting-point-node-id=83%3A1058) or [mobile](https://www.figma.com/proto/eF8Nwqi88dUXHkD92kE4xA/Smart-Room-Prototype?node-id=83%3A3588&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=83%3A3144&starting-point-node-id=83%3A3588) version immediately.
